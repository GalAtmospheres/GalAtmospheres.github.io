Content is written in [Markdown](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/).
Plain texxt format allows you to focus on your **content**.

# This is an <h1>
## This is an <h2>
### This is an <h3>
#### This is an <h4>
##### This is an <h5>
###### This is an <h6>

 *This text is in italics.*
_And so is this text._

__And so is this text.__

***This text is in both.***
**_As is this!_**
*__And this!__*
